    "Dryness, acne, redness, ageing signs, your skin has its own way of telling you that you aren't paying enough attention. One thing that is important and will help you deal with most of your skin issues is hydration. Drinking enough water is important for your skin. Every time I ask a celebrity for their beauty secret they say they keep themselves hydrated all through the day. Now you know the secret of their spotless skin? To achieve that glowing skin, you need to drink a lot of water.\n\nWater helps you improve blood flow in your skin. It gives your skin that natural glow you wish for. Water has essential vitamins and minerals which renew your skin cell. When your skin cells are healthy, your skin starts to glow from within and it looks naturally bright. You should be drinking a glass of water every 45 minutes.\n\nIf you don't like the taste of plain water, add flavour to your water by adding fruits, cucumber, mint or lemon to it."
